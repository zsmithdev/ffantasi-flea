# Ffantasi Flea Market - Milestone Project One

## Project Description
This project has been created for a fictional flea market, Ffantasi Flea. Located in Cardiff, the market holds seasonal, street market-style events that bring together vendors and buyers of unique second hand goods.

## User Experience

### Strategy
In creating this website, I am looking to cater to both business goals and the needs of users.

The organisers of the flea market are looking to attract traders and buyers, to bring in revenue and keep the market functioning. The market looks to promote itself as trendy and contemporary, catering to the large student and young professional population of Cardiff. 

In relation to this, potential market attendees are looking for information related to upcoming events, location, contact information and goods available at the market. The website should also make clear in what ways the ethos of the market matches the consumer's self-perception. Therefore, user needs must be addressed by providing this information in a succinct and accessible way.

### Scope

Based on the conclusions drawn in the strategy plane, the most important features for the website were undoubtedly information about the market events. This includes the time and dates, as well as the location and contacts for requesting further information. The events are effectively the product in this context, and therefore this allows users to know how to access the product.

As the markets do not necessarily follow a consistent schedule due to seasonal and capacity-related limitations, an option to sign up to the mailing list for new events will be an important addition. Instead of having to manually check the website for updates, this sign-up link will allow users to receive updates on market events straight to their inbox. 

A page dedicated to vendors who attend the market will be useful as this informs buyers of what is available, and potential vendors can assess where they fit in the existing market. In conjunction with this, a gallery feature would a gallery feature would be valuable in catering to user needs. The type and quality of the second hand goods available at the market can be communicated to the user best through a highly visual display such as a gallery of these goods.
