            <p>In 2020, like many small businesses, Ffantasi Flea ground to a halt. For the safety of all attendees, the
                market was closed until further notice. During this period, the future of our market was uncertain and
                we were afraid to lose the space we had created.</p>

            <p><strong>In 1998</strong>, a group of eco-conscious Cardiff locals wanted to elevate their local car boot
                into something
                more. They sought to create a space that celebrated shopping second hand. As such, Ffantasi Flea Market
                was born.</p>

            <p>In 2022, the goals of Ffantasi Flea continue to center around fostering community spirit, promoting
                sustainability and sparking joy in the little things. Considering the impact the pandemic continues to
                have on the UK and the world, these values are more important now than ever.</p>

            <p>However, with the green light to reopen in 2021, our market is back and better than ever. We continue to
                operate under social distance protocols, upholding our responsibility to protect the more vulnerable
                members of our society.</p>

            <p>Since then, our market has grown into a platform for local events, a community space and one of the best
                flea markets in the UK. Attracting traders from all over the UK, we have a vast selection of goods
                available ranging from vintage clothes and antique homeware to books and bric-a-brac.</p>
